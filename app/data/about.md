#### Intro

I am a full-stack software engineer at [Andela](https://andela.com) where I work on engineering infrastructure and build tools to price gas for livelihood consumptions in Tanzania. My primary job functions are as a Machine Learning and Software Engineer.
<br>
I am available to consult on interesting projects. I am particularly interested in social impact, education, inclusivity, and science. I enjoy advising companies and may even be available for pro-bono work depending on the time commitment and the project. If you would like to arrange a meeting, I am based in Mbeya but travel to Dar es salaam frequently.
<br><br>

#### Currently

At Andela I have learned how to build teams and manage people, build relationships with customers, sell enterprise products, and build on-line predictive models for production environments. I've also learned how to build and maintain large web applications (see [memoirs.com](https://memoirs.netlify.app)).

#### Some history

- After the death of my father, my mother sent me to a boarding school where I saw a computer for the first time in 2003, when I was 8. It was an old Compaq machine that ran Windows 1995. My favorite games were Street Rod 2,Solitaire, Wolfenstein 3D, and Tom and Jerry. It had a mechanical keyboard,it lacked a mouse but had a turbo button. To this day, I still don't know what pressing the turbo button really did.

- We subscribed to Windows 2003 in 2004. I still remember installing it from a floppy disk onto our brand new Packard Bell. It took years for me to send my first email.

- In the summer of 2004, my brother purchased [MegaRace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MegaRace) from [Media Play](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_Play) and installed it on my mom's work computer. I might have endangered her business by using her computer too much.

- At 11, I discovered the mini-games hidden in Microsoft Office. I also beat Minesweeper on expert for the first time.

- At 13, my mother bought me a Sony Mavica MVC-FD71 digital camera after I stole her SLR one too many times. It could fit 10 images to a floppy disk at a 0.3MP resolution. I still have it and it still works. I've been taking photographs ever since, now with a Canon D3, D6, and occasionally with a Nikon D750.

- At 16, I built my first website with Microsoft FrontPage on our Pentium III [Gateway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gateway,_Inc.). My website was terrible.

- I was 17 when I built my first [Tesla Coil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_coil) (without the permission of my parents). Over the next few years, I built several more including one of the first audio modulated coils and one of the first DRSSTCs.

- When I was 18, I set the all-time high record at my local laser tag facility by reverse engineering the charging station and weapon protocols with a photo-resistor, micro-cassette recorder, and a lot of patience. I was unstoppable.

- At 18, I learned to program a computer and fell in love.I learned C# and ASP.NET for a year and built a lot of websites and apps which were really cool.I got bored with the language for almost everything had to be built and work on the microsoft ecosystem.I learned Python,Django and REST API so that I can build something robust such as an online payment system,which I did and shared the code on [github](https://.www.github.com/gwamakacharles).

- At 20, I was almost expelled for finding a backdoor into my university's file server and telling everyone but the faculty members about it. Later that year, I figured out how to turn off the internet firewall by editing system registry keys. I anonymously shared my work months later.

- At 21, I participated in a foreign exchange program in Arusha, Tanzania. Since then, I've gone back almost every year.

- 14 - 17, I played a lot of video games. My favorites included Counter Strike Source, Command and Conquer 3, Halo 2, and Age of Empires 3.

- At 21, I took my first graduate course and published my first academic paper.

- At 22, I decided that I won't go back to college and use the funds I had to learn Computer Science courses and Programming online.I learnt a lot of Advanced Programming courses from stanford university website.

- At 23, I joined Caritas Development Office as a data entry officer so that I can fund my online education.The organization was impressed with my computer science skills and decided to hire me as an assistant monitoring and evaluation officer. I learnt and practiced a lot of data science skills to help our project and in a span of 6 months I got promoted to monitoring and evaluation officer.

- At 25, I joined Deloitte Consulting ltd as a monitoring and evaluation officer of the USAID Boresha Afya project based in Njombe.I quit the job later that year for I felt the window for me to learn data science and programming was very small and that wasn't the path I wanted to pursue for my life.

- At 26, I joined Andela as a Software Engineer.

You can ask me in person for other stories that I'm afraid to share with the internet.
